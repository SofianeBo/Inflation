# Inflation

This code calculates the predictions of cosmic [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)) for single field inflatons. The code includes the two non-standard cases of the presence of quantum corrections to the potential and of non-minimal coupling of the inflaton to gravity.

This code was used for the cosmo calculation of these papers:
